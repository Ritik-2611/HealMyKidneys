# HealMyKidneys
Emphasizes the healing &amp; status-checking feature

## About
KidneyCare API is a RESTful Express.js-based backend service that simulates kidney health management for a patient. It supports core CRUD operations to monitor, add, heal, and remove kidneys based on their health status (healthy or unhealthy). The API is built around a single user and uses JSON to track each kidney's state. It includes:

– View total, healthy, and unhealthy kidneys

– Add a new kidney with health status

– Heal all unhealthy kidneys

– Remove all unhealthy kidneys

This project is ideal for learning backend fundamentals like routing, HTTP methods, request handling, and state management in-memory (without a database). It’s a fun and medical-inspired way to understand how APIs work.
